# JS-Real-Time-Market-Data-Forecasting

I use the CNN & XGBoost as the tools to do the JS Real Time Market Data Forcasting.

```python
JS-Real-Time-Market-Data-Forecasting/
├── Data/ # Data directory, too big to upload, follow the report to build by yourself.
    ├── train.parquet/ # Download raw data to this directory
    └── dataset/ # Run the code in `data_preprocess/` to get the dataset.
├── CodeCNN/ # Code directory for CNN Model.
├── CodeXGBoost/ # Code directory for XGboost Model.
├── Imgs/ # All images used.
├── Doc/ # Documents.
├── README-CNN.md # .md format report for CNN.
├── README-XGBoost.md # .md format report for XGBoost.
└── requirements.txt # The dependencies. 
```

Please see the `README-CNN.md` and `README-XGBoost.md` for more detailed information.
